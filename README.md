# RAM CTF

Minecraft's Simplest Capture the Flag Plugin





## About

RAM CTF is meant to be a super easy to use capture the flag experience. It has several customizable features, but the customization is kept to a minimum to allow for ease of use. The flag location can be set anywhere, and a 3x3 area around the flag will be unbreakable to prevent the flag from being covered up. If the flag carrier is killed, the flag will automatically be recovered after a minute. There is an optional pregame timer where players will have time to collect resources prior to the start of the game. You can go into the settings to disable this timer if you wish to use premade kits instead. This pregame timer, as well as the game timer, is customizable in the settings.
