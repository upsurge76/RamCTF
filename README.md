# RAM CTF: Simple Capture the Flag

Ram CTF is a lightweight and easy-to-use Capture the Flag plugin for Spigot/Bukkit servers. All configuration is managed through in-game GUI menus.

## Commands
- `/setup` - The main command for game setup, which opens the GUI menu. *(Requires OP/Admin permissions)*
- `/team` - Opens the team selection menu.

## Features
- **Flag Protection**: An optional 3x3 area around each team's flag is indestructible. This ensures that the flag cannot be buried or otherwise made inaccessible
- **Pregame Resource Collection**: An optional pregame timer can be enabled, allowing time to gather resources
- **Customizable Timers**: Both the pregame and main game timers are fully customizable
- **Flag Carrier Identification**: Flag carriers have a glowing effect, allowing them to be seen behind walls. They also emit colored particles of the flag they stole
- **Regen Effect**: Killing a player during the match gives a regeneration effect for 4 seconds. This can be disabled
